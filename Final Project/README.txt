My idea is to create a page to help musicians share instruments. If someone has an instrument that they do not use all the time, they can post it as available and someone who needs to use it for a couple days can pick it up. If someone needs an instrument or even a musician for a studio day of recording, I want the website to be able to help match people and instruments up. The data that would be useful would be a database that can be added to and deleted from that shows all of the musicians and instruments that can be chosen. The database would track who it belongs to and who has it and for how long. I would only need an internal database. One user wants to record in a professional studio in a couple days but is short a guitar player and guitar. This person could go on the webpage and select that they need a musician who has their own instrument for those specific days and then select what kind of instrument. They would be shown a list of the available musicians for those dates. Another person goes on the website to find a xylophone for a gig they are playing in a couple days. They need a xylophone for a single song and they know how to play it, but since they don't use it much and don't have storage space for it, they don't want to buy their own. After searching for a xylophone that is available for the dates they use it, they contact the owner and set up a time to go pick it up. From the inside, there needs to be a database that will store the information of the instruments and musicians (each will be an object type). There will be a search function that will match the search details to the items in the database and display the correct ones. I think I can do this with the knowledge from this class.

Wrote the text for the HTML page, completed the database for storing data, created a little data to put in the database, created a style document to style everything with css.
Need to implement the search function
Need to connect the HTML to the SQL database to do queries
Need to create a box in which to show the results and information from the database query
